  My background.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

 I have been at Amazon since August 2020. In my current role as an Economist I solve challenging problems in retail profitability management.
  
  I particularly enjoy designing new intelligent systems using state-of-the-art causal machine learning methods and generating actionable managerial insights from micro level data. The projects that I delivered so far, have an estimated annual impact worth $200MM  to Amazon's retail business.
  
  Throughout my doctorate studies I researched and specialized in improving the customer experience in online marketplaces through targeted marketing initiatives. I contributed to the literature by publishing part of my dissertation at  Management Science, a top academic journal in my field. You can read more about my research in [portfolio](/project). I also had the privilege of sharing my knowledge through teaching. In fall 2021, I designed and taught a [machine learning class](/project/teaching) to graduate students at Cornell University. I truly believe that the ultimate test to check your understanding of a difficult concept is to try teaching it to someone. Teaching machine learning, in that vein, has allowed me to grow in many ways in my career. 
  
  Before moving into economics and data science, I was a Ranger officer in the Turkish Army. During my 7 years in the Army, I successfully commanded Ranger units ranging from 20 to 80 elite soldiers in planning, preparing, and executing life-saving counter-terrorism missions that equipped me with leadership and decision-making skills under highly stressful and ambiguous conditions. In 2009, I was selected to represent the Turkish Army in the [US Army Ranger and Airborne Course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_School), an elite combat leadership course, and succeeded to graduate among the minority of the candidates.
  
On a personal note, I am passionate about backpacking, which gives me ample opportunities for experiencing [type-2 fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale). Some of my favorite excursions include the John-Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada and the rim-to-rim-to-rim hike in the Grand Canyon.
